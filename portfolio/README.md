# Real-Time Portfolio via JMS and WebSockets

This web application uses WebSocket for update stocks info in real-time (based on the data provided by a back-end service over JMS) as well as simulates trades.
The application allows you to buy stocks with available cash (the initial total value of $10,000) and sell stocks, depending of the number of shares available.
