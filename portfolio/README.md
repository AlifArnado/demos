# Real-Time Portfolio via JMS and WebSockets

This demo application uses WebSocket to update stock price information in real-time. Simulated price data is provided by a back-end service over JMS (Java Message System) built with Apache ActiveMQ. The demo application allows you to simulate the buying and selling of stocks with an initial fake balance of $10,000. Although the initial prices shown in the demo are current, the high-speed changes are simulated and should not inform any real world trading decisions.
